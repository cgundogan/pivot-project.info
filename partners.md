## Joint forces for an open IoT

In PIVOT, all partners share the common interest of an open and privacy-friendly IoT.
The consortium reflects the entire innovation chain. 
Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin and HAW Hamburg co-founded the popular
[RIOT](https://riot-os.org) IoT operating system (OS). As of today, RIOT has a 5% global IoT OS
market share. Furthermore, a strong binational LoRa development community has been
established.  Afnic, Lobaro, HAW Hamburg, FU Berlin, and TTN Berlin are part of
it. Particular contributions to IoT privacy come from INSA in this
context. Finally, international Internet standardisation is in focus of FU
Berlin, HAW Hamburg, and Afnic---they jointly work in the IETF since more than 10
years.
