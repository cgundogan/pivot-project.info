  abstract = {This paper evaluates four forwarding strategies for fragmented datagrams in the IoT on top of the common CSMA/CA MAC implementation for IEEE 802.15.4: hop-wise reassembly, a minimal approach to direct forwarding of fragments, classic end-to-end fragmentation, and direct forwarding utilizing selective fragment recovery. Additionally, we evaluate congestion control mechanisms for selective fragment recovery by increasing the feature set of congestion control. Direct fragment forwarding and selective fragment recovery are challenged by the lack of forwarding information at subsequent fragments in 6LoWPAN and thus require additional data at the nodes. We compare the four approaches in extensive experiments evaluating reliability, end-to-end latency, and memory consumption. Our findings indicate that direct fragment forwarding should be deployed with care, since higher packet transmission rates on the link layer can significantly reduce its reliability, which in turn can even further reduce end-to-end latency because of highly increased link layer retransmissions. Selective fragment recovery can compensate this disadvantage but struggles with the same problem underneath, constraining its full potential. Congestion control for selective fragment recovery should be chosen so that small congestion windows that are growable together with fragment pacing are used. In case of less fragments per datagram, pacing is less of a concern, but the congestion window has an upper bound.},

In this poster, we propose an authorization mechanism for LwM2M clients for gaining access to resources hosted by other clients. Access rights are issued by LwM2M servers. We introduce a new LwM2M interface and new LwM2M objects with minimal backwards-compatible changes to the core specification.},

  abstract = {Content objects are confined data elements that carry meaningful information. Massive amounts of content objects are published and exchanged  every day on the Internet.  The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) augments the network edge with reading sensors  and controlling actuators that comprise machine-to-machine communication using small data objects. IoT content objects are often messages that fit into single IPv6 datagram. These IoT messages  frequently traverse protocol translators at gateways, which break end-to-end transport and security of Internet protocols.   To preserve content security from end to end via gateways and proxies, the IETF recently developed Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), which extends the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) with content object security features commonly known from Information Centric Networking (ICN).

This paper revisits the current IoT protocol architectures and presents a comparative analysis of protocol stacks that protect request-response transactions. We discuss features and limitations of the different protocols and analyze emerging functional extensions.
We measure the protocol performances of CoAP over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), OSCORE, and the information-centric Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol on a large-scale IoT testbed in single- and multi-hop scenarios.
Our findings indicate that (a) OSCORE improves on CoAP over DTLS in error-prone wireless regimes due to omitting the  overhead of maintaining security sessions at endpoints,  (b) NDN attains superior robustness and reliability due to its intrinsic network caches and hop-wise retransmissions, and (c) OSCORE/CoAP offers room for improvement and optimization in multiple directions.},

  abstract = {Security in the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ways to regularly update firmware  in the field. These demands ever increase with new, agile concepts such as security as code and should be considered a regular operation. Hosting massive firmware roll-outs present a crucial challenge for the constrained wireless environment.

In this paper, we explore how information-centric networking can ease reliable firmware updates. We start from the recent standards developed by the IETF SUIT working group and contribute a system that allows for a timely discovery of new firmware versions by using cryptographically protected manifest files. Our design enables a cascading firmware roll-out from a gateway towards leaf nodes in a low-power multi-hop network. While a chunking mechanism prepares firmware images for typically low-sized maximum transmission units (MTUs), an early Denial-of-Service (DoS) detection prevents the distribution of tampered or malformed chunks. In experimental evaluations on a real-world IoT testbed, we demonstrate feasible strategies with adaptive bandwidth consumption and a high resilience to connectivity loss when replicating firmware images into the IoT edge.},

  abstract  = {Content replication to many destinations is common in the IoT. IP multicast has proven inefficient due to a missing layer-2 support by IoT radios and its synchronous end-to-end transmission, which is susceptible to interference. Information-centric networking (ICN) introduced hop-wise multiparty dissemination of cacheable content, which proves valuable for lossy networks. Even Named-Data Networking (NDN), a prominent ICN, suffers from a lack of deployment. We explore a multiparty content distribution in an information-centric Web of Things built on CoAP. We augment CoAP proxies by request aggregation and response replication, which together with caches enable asynchronous group communication. Further, we integrate object security with OSCORE into the CoAP multicast proxy system for ubiquitous caching of certified content. We compare NDN, CoAP, and our data-centric approach in testbed experiments. Our findings indicate that multiparty content distribution with CoAP proxies performs equally well as NDN, while remaining compatible with the protocol world of CoAP.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a popular technology that enables long-range wireless communication (kilometers) at low energy consumption. The transmission exhibits low throughput and underlies duty cycle restrictions. Long on-air times (up to seconds) and range are susceptible to interference. In parallel, common LoRa-devices are battery driven and should mainly sleep.
  LoRaWAN is the system that defines the LoRa PHY, MAC, and a complete vertical stack. To deal with the above limitations, LoRaWAN imposes rigorous constraints, namely, a centralized network architecture that organizes media access, and heavily reduced downlink capacity. This makes it unusable for many deployments, control systems in particular.
  In this work, we combine IEEE\,802.15.4 DSME and LoRa to facilitate node-to-node communication. We present a DSME-LoRa mapping scheme and contribute a simulation model for validating new LoRa use-cases. Our results show 100\% packet delivery and predictable latencies irrespective of network size.},

  abstract  = {Random numbers are an essential input to many functions on the Internet of Things (IoT). Common use cases of randomness range from low-level packet transmission to advanced algorithms of artificial intelligence as well as security and trust, which heavily rely on unpredictable random sources. In the constrained IoT, though, unpredictable random sources are a challenging desire due to limited resources, deterministic real-time operations, and frequent lack of a user interface. In this paper, we revisit the generation of randomness from the perspective of an IoT operating system (OS) that needs to support general purpose or crypto-secure random numbers. We analyse the potential attack surface, derive common requirements, and discuss the potentials and shortcomings of current IoT OSs. A systematic evaluation of current IoT hardware components and popular software generators based on well-established test suits and on experiments for measuring performance give rise to a set of clear recommendations on how to build such a random subsystem and which generators to use.},
