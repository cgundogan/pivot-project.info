  abstract = {Communication scenarios between IoT client nodes within an authenticated and authorized regime comprise emerging use cases for modern edge applications in the IoT, but unfortunately are not supported by current management schemes such as LwM2M. In this poster, we propose an authorization mechanism for LwM2M clients for gaining access to resources hosted by other clients. Access rights are issued by LwM2M servers. We introduce a new LwM2M interface and new LwM2M objects with minimal backwards-compatible changes to the core specification.},
